# rfid-door-lock
RFID-Operated Door Lock
This is a project written for Arduino.

## Dependencies
1. Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. You would have to follow my tutorial on how to setup the hardware part for this project. Bad news is that I haven't finished writing it. Will update here when I do, should be anytime now.

## Getting Started
1. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/PortableIDE) to copy the `portable` folder you find in this repository into the root of the Arduino IDE folder.
2. Fire up the IDE and load the `rfid-lock` project.
3. Connect the Arduino Uno and upload the project.
4. Enjoy!
